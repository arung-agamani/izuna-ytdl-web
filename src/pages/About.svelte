    <br />
    <p>
        This web application is created to satisfy my needs of occassionally
        downloading Youtube videos as MP3 files, particularly on music and audio
        samples. The tools that are available in the internet are not something
        that give me good experience. So I think I'll just create my own tool.

        This web app uses Python for the backend as it heavily relies on <A

            href="https://github.com/arung-agamani/izuna-ytdl">Github</A
        >. The frontend itself is built using Svelte and can be found in the <A
